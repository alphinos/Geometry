# Geometry

## - [ ] **Applying OOP concepts* :yellow_circle:
* Just like the Gomes' Stationary project for the "Linguagens de Programação II"'s subject, it's an activity to practice and - actually learn - some other concepts of the OOP paradigm.
* This ones uses interfaces, abstract classes and a good amount of the basics of geometry.
* Given the simplicity of this, there are only triangles, rectangles and squares here.

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and everythng.
Thank you :D
